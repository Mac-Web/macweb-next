Second, we fixed the panic button settings, so that you can only enter one panic button instead of a combination, because of glitches and inefficiency.

Ads help support us so we can continuosly roll out new features, ne games, and more. You will now see ads on almost every page on MacVG, but we promise they will never be intrusive or annoying. Please disable adblockers if you're using them on MacVG because this is the only MacVG can survive and keep adding new content for you guys. Thanks 💻."

We also added Featured and Downloadable filters to the filter dropdown for you to browse new games! Other than these new features, there's also a new Sort Direction button next to the Sort & Filter dropdowns that sorts all the games by acsending or descending order. This makes looking up new games easier and saves you from scrolling to the bottom. With these quality of life changes, MacVG is now friendlier and easier to use than ever 🌱!"

To name a few, we hugely optimized the code, added new game descriptions and controls and made unfinished game descriptions and game controls invisible, search is now not laggy at all and results appear instantly, and deleted and organized a bunch of files to make the site faster. We're also transitioning from an unblocked game site for school to an actual game platform for the general audience. Because of this, we removed the panic button as it's buggy and not many people actually use it. We also updated the Settings tab and its description. Other than all these, we also fixed the Recents Tab so it actually works and shows all the games you've played recently. We also added a new Clear Recents option in case the page gets too cluttered up. We also removed some broken games and updated some games' thumbnails. With these updates, we hope to provide a better experience while using MacVG 📈!"

Along with the gamer profile, we're also introducing streaks in this update, so keep logging on MacVG everyday, grow the streak, and earn that shiny badge displayed at the top of your profile!

On top of that, we also added lazy loading of all the games on the home page so only a small section of it renders at once so your poor potato school computer doesn't have to render every game's thumbnail at once, significantly boosting the performance and speed of the game site. We also optimized SEO and monetization to make MacVG more discoverable and make the community more engaged by introducing the brand new exciting Discord server.
